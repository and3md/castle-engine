{ @abstract(Utilities for dealing with more difficult VRML geometry
  nodes.)

  For some geometry nodes, calculating their vertices (and other properties)
  is non-trivial enough to be separated into a unit. We want to reuse
  this by VRMLOpenGLRenderer, and by TVRMLGeometryNode.BoundingBox calculation,
  and by TVRMLGeometryNode.Triangulate etc.

  Normal users of our engine should not use this unit directly
  (it's functionality is indirectly available to you when rendering,
  or calculating collisions with this geometry).
  Interface of this unit and it's classes is unstable, suited only to the
  current needs of other parts of the engine. }

      that closed spine -> always produces the same automatic orientation
      calculated at the beginning and end (X, Y, Z vectors in
